<h2>OWNERSHIP</h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The user that is buying and minting our Geks World NFT artwork is
    the owner of the Non Fungible Token (NFT) crated by validating the
    transaction. Each Geks World NFT is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
    When you purchase an NFT, you own all the rights to the underlying Geks
    World NFT. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely and only by the
    Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network which means that, at no point,
    may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Geks World NFT.

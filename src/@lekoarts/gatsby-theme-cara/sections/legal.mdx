Geks World NFT is a collection of digital artworks running on the
Ethereum network via non fungible tokens(NFTs). gekyume.io is only
a visual interface to allow users to acquire the digital artworks.
</li>

<li>
Users are responsible for the safety and management of their own
Ethereum wallet and validating all transactions and contracts related
and generated by gekyume.io before approval. Also be aware that, since
our GeksWorld NFT smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, it
is not possible to undo, reverse or restore any transactions.

Gekyume.io and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as

are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions
involving Geks World NFT digital artworks.

Although we truly believe in this project, this project should be considered
strictly an NFT art project that could eventually provide utilities for its
holders. However, we do not guarantee any profitability for the buyers
and it is understood that this is not the goal or the reason of the project.
This project should not be considered as an investment.
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
As part of this project, we offer, in good faith, several giveaways.
Depending on the popularity, scope and sales of the Geks World NFT NFT project,
we reserve the right to reduce or cancel these giveaways. Also, it is
understood that some giveaways will only be made if the collection sells out.
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
For all our giveaways with a physical prize, we reserve the right to pay
the equivalent of the prize in ETH instead of giving the physical prize. Giveaways
will be in person in Tampa, FL with flight within US and one night accomodation provided.
Minors will require a parent or guardian present to accept giveaway. The timestamp of the
block when the last NFT is minted will determine the winner by randomly setting the initial
sequence of tokens with two unique traits determining the winner.
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
In the events that Jen, an employee or agent of the company or other related party is randomly
selected for either giveaway, a random holder will be chosen via Chainlink
Randon Number Generator.

## Project

Geks World NFT Club is the premier NFT club with members only events and access to up and coming artists and celebrity parties where you can mingle and party with the stars.

Geks World NFTs are ERC-721 tokens stored on the Ethereum blockchain and stored in the interplanetary filesystem (IPFS).

Our mission is to bridge the metaverse and reality by connecting artists and fans via members only events and parties throughout the world and VIP sections at music events.

As a holder of our NFTs you will have access to invite-only exclusive events hosted by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenesisgiselle/?hl=en">@JenesisGiselle</a>, with different artists. Network with music industry professionals, show off your mixtape and producing skills or just sip on 1942 with your favorite artist.
